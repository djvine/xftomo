        Performs filtered back-projection in order to reconstruct 
        an image based on its projections.
        
        Filtered back-projection is the most common means of 
        reconstructing images from CT scans.  It is a two step 
        process: First, each of the projections is filtered with 
        a `rho filter', so named due to its frequency domain 
        definition, which is simply |rho|, where rho is the radial 
        axis in a polar coordinate system.  Second, the filtered 
        projections are each `smeared' across the image space.  
        This is the back-projection part.
        
        Inputs
        ------
        proj : The set of projections to reconstruct from.  It
          should be an ndarray with each column being a projection.
        
        theta : The list of angles from which the projections
          were taken from.  If `theta' is a scalar and more than one
          projection is given, it is assumed that projections are 
          equally spaced with angle `theta' between them.
          Angles should be given in degrees.
        
        interp : The interpolation method to be used when back-
          projecting. Should be one of "nearest", "linear", and
          "spline".
        
        filt : The rho-filter to use.  Should be one of "none",
          "ram-lak", "hamming", "hann", "cosine", and "shepp-logan".
          "none" specifies that no rho filtering should be applied.
          "ram-lak" is just the standard rho-filter.
          The others specify the window to apply to the standard
          rho-filter, where "shepp-logan" is a sinc function.
        
        scaling : Lame Matlab option.  Needs to be 0 <= scaling <= 1.
          Squeezes the rho-filter down, putting zeros at higher
          frequencies.
        
        output_size : Sets the edge length of the (square) output
          image.  If omitted, this will be guessed from the projections.
          Guessing is done by considering several values:
            1. Assume the projection length is the hypotenuse
               of the image.
            2. Find the non-zero width of a projection at angle 0
               or thereabouts.
            3. Find the non-zero width of a projection at angle 90
               or thereabouts.
          The edge length is set to the smallest value that satisfies
          all of these constraints.
        
        ret_filter : If this is set to True, return the filter
          transfer function as a second return value.
        
        Outputs
        -------
        recon : The image reconstructed from the projections.
        
        filt_tf : The transfer function of the rho-filter that was
          used.  Only returned if `ret_filter' is True.

        Performs rho filtering on the parallel ray projections provided.

        Rho filtering is performed as part of the filtered back-
        projection method of CT image reconstruction.  It is the 
        `filtered' part of the name.
        The simplest rho filter is the Ramachadran-Lakshminarayanan 
        (Ram-Lak), which is simply |rho|, where rho is the radial 
        component of spatial frequency.  However, this can cause 
        unwanted amplification of noise, which is what the other 
        types attempt to minimise, by introducing roll-off into the 
        response. The Hann and Hamming filters multiply the standard 
        response by a Hann or Hamming window, respectively.  The 
        cosine filter is the standard response multiplied by a cosine
        shape, and the Shepp-Logan filter multiplies the response with
        a sinc shape.  The `none' filter performs no filtering, and is
        included for completeness and to enable incorporating this 
        function easily into scripts or functions that may offer the 
        ability to choose to apply no filtering.

        This function is designed to be used by the function `iradon',
        but has been exposed to facilitate custom inverse radon 
        transforms and to more clearly break down the process for 
        educational purposes.
